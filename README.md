# Pros and Cons

Optimizing large boolean functions is a complex and resource-intensive task. Generating the shortest possible function is highly demanding due to its complexity. However, this program aims to approximate the optimal solution efficiently, avoiding any O(n^3) operations. Generally, it performs as O(n^2). 

<h3> Pros </h3>
<h5> Efficiently approximates the optimal solution for optimizing boolean functions. </h5>
<h5> Avoids high-complexity operations (O(n^3)), leading to better performance.</h5> 
<h5> Generally performs with a complexity closer to O(n^2).</h5>
<h3> Cons </h3>
<h5> Does not always generate the exact shortest possible function due to the complexity of the task.</h5> 
<h5> Optimizing very large functions can still be challenging and resource-intensive. </h5>
